# TypeScript Tutorial

TypeScript is typed JavaScript. TypeScript adds types to JavaScript to help you speed up the development by catching errors before you even run the JavaScript code.

TypeScript is an open-source programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It works on any web browser, any OS, and any environment that JavaScript runs.

## What You'll Learn

- Why TypeScript offers a lot of benefits over vanilla JavaScript
- Understand what TypeScript truly is and how it works under the hood
- Use TypeScript and its rich features like Types, Classes, Interfaces, Modules, and more

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have:

- Basic JavaScript knowledge. If you want to learn JavaScript, check out the JavaScript Tutorial.
- ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 knowledge

### Section 3: Control Flow Statements

The following tutorials refresh your control flow statement knowledge. If you are already familiar with these statements in JavaScript, please skip this section.

- **if…else** – Learn how to execute code based on a condition
- **switch..case** – Show you how to use the switch statement to allow some of the possible execution paths
- **for** – Create a loop that executes a specified number of times
- **while** – Create a pretest loop that executes as long as a condition is true
- **do…while** – Learn how to create a posttest loop that executes until a condition is false
- **break** – Show you how to use the break statement to terminate a loop or a switch
- **continue** – Learn how to skip to the end of a loop and continue to the next iteration

### Section 4: Functions

- **Functions** – Learn how to declare a function that uses type annotation in TypeScript
- **Function types** – Guide you on how to use function types to define types for functions
- **Optional Parameters** – Show you how to define functions with optional parameters
- **Default Parameters** – Introduce you to default parameters
- **Rest Parameters** – Use the rest parameters to handle an infinite number of arguments of a function
- **Function overloadings** – Learn how to establish between parameter types and results of a function via function overloadings

### Section 5: Classes

- **Classes** – Learn how to construct a class in TypeScript
- **Access Modifiers** – Introduce you to private, protected, and public access modifiers
- **The readonly Modifier** – Learn how to use the readonly modifier to make class properties immutable
- **Getters & Setters** – Show you how to use the getters and setters to control the access of the class properties
- **Inheritance** – Learn how to use the inheritance to reuse the functionality of another class
- **Static methods & properties** – Define static methods and variables shared by all instances of a class
- **Abstract Classes** – Explain the abstract classes that define some common behaviors

### Section 6: Interfaces

- **Interfaces** – Introduce you to interfaces and how to use them for creating contracts within your code
- **Extending Interfaces** – Learn how to extend an interface to create a combination of interfaces
- **Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes** – Explain the differences between interfaces and abstract classes

### Section 7: Advanced Types

- **Intersection Types** – Show you how to create a new type that has all the features of existing types
- **Type Guards** – Learn how to use type guards to narrow the type of a variable within a conditional block
- **Type Assertions** – Guide you on using a type assertion to tell the compiler to treat a value as a specified type

### Section 8: Generics

- **Introduction to TypeScript Generics** – Learn how to use TypeScript generics to develop generic functions
- **Generic constraints** – Show you how to add constraints to the generic types
- **Generic Classes** – Guide you on how to develop generic classes
